## OS X Manual Installation

### Perl Support
Perl is part of the OS X base system, so no installation is necessary.

Additional Perl modules may be installed using the [[local::lib method|manual]] described for Linux/Unix.  Note that the LWP and XML::Simple modules are already installed with the system Perl on OS X.

### External Programs

WIP

### Command-line Interface (CLI)

Use the CLI [[manual installation procedure|manual]] described for Linux/Unix.

### Web PVR Manager (WPM)

Use the WPM [[manual installation procedure|manual]] described for Linux/Unix.
