h2. get_iplayer Tagging

h2. Installation

The changes described here have been incorporated into get_iplayer 2.80+.  Windows users should download version 4.4+ of the get_iplayer Windows installer "*here*":http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer_win/get_iplayer_setup_latest.exe

h2. Usage

h3. Invocation

There is no change in the invocation of get_iplayer.  If the MP3::Tag module is installed, it will automatically be utilised.  If not, get_iplayer  will fall back to using id3v2 for MP3 tagging, if available.  AtomicParsley is still used for MP4 tagging.

h2. Tagging

h3. Tag Scheme

The tag scheme is described "*here*":https://github.com/dinkypumpkin/get_iplayer/wiki/tagscheme

If you wish to experiment with variations, the conversion of get_iplayer metadata to tag values is encapsulated in the _Tagger::tags_from_metadata_ subroutine.

h3. Tag Encodings

The get_iplayer metadata is assumed to be encoded as UTF-8 and is then re-encoded as necessary for the different tagging applications.  This doesn't always hold true, so substitution characters may sometimes appear in the tags, particularly _lyrics_ or _longDescription_.

h3. Tagging Differences

Aside from the additional tags available, there are four notable differences from the previous scheme:

# MP4 tagging differed from MP3 tagging in that it used the full programme title (including series).  To harmonise things, I chose the MP3 style of using the shorter episode title as the default.  The ==--==tag-fulltitle option was added to use the full programme title instead.
# See the notes regarding _genre_ in the tagging scheme description referenced above.  Rather than using the previous MP4 style of assigning the full list of programme categories as the genre, I've implemented some logic to select a single category as the genre.  Many media managers, including iTunes, cannot work with multi-valued genres.  The full category list is retained in the _grouping_ tag.
# The album artist is now set based on the programme @<type>@ (radio, tv, podcast).  This more generic value was chosen because @<channel>@ is already recorded for the programme artist and a higher-level classification will offer additional flexibility in formulating playlists and searches.
# A copyright notice is included in deference to our licence fee overlords. There is usually a copyright notice embedded in the source media.  The tag value in effect preserves it.
