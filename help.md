## Getting Help

get_iplayer can provide brief usage examples and descriptions of available options.  Because there are quite a few options, help listings are available at three levels of detail:

``` bash
get_iplayer --help
get_iplayer --basic-help
get_iplayer --long-help
```

Linux/Unix/OS X users who installed a packaged version of get_iplayer may have access to a manual page:

```
man get_iplayer
```

Windows users can go to **get_iplayer -> Help -> get_iplayer Example Commands** in the Start menu.  If you are using the Windows 8 Start screen you will need to show "All Apps" to see the **get_iplayer Example Commands** button.

Web PVR Manager users should click the **Help** button at the top right of the page.
