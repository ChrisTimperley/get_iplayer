### Web PVR Manager and Internet Explorer 11

The Web PVR Manager may not launch properly after you upgrade to Internet Explorer 11.  Instead, IE 11 may display the error message "This page canâ€™t be displayed".  This is due to IE 11's Enhanced Protected Mode, which blocks access to servers running on the machine's loopback address (127.0.0.1).  By default, the Web PVR Manager's server component runs on the loopback address at: `http://127.0.0.1:1935`.  To work around this restriction, download a new get_iplayer installer from:

<http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer_win/get_iplayer_setup_latest.exe>

and update to get_iplayer 2.85.  When you run the installer, only the "get_iplayer" component should be selected for re-installation.  There is no need to re-install the helper applications.  After updating get_iplayer, the Web PVR Manager shortcut will launch with your browser directed to `http://localhost:1935`.

*2013-11-12*: Microsoft have reversed course and now disable Enhanced Protected Mode by default in the desktop version  of IE 11, though EPM is still enabled by default in the Modern UI version.  All Windows 7+ users should still update to get_iplayer 2.85 in order to work with all permutations of EPM settings in IE 11.
