## Contribute to get_iplayer

### Code

If you would like to contribute to get_iplayer development, fork the repository on GitHub and submit a pull request with your changes:

<https://github.com/dinkypumpkin/get_iplayer>

Follow a few basic guidelines for pull requests:

- Each pull request should contain only one new feature or a fix for a single bug.

- Each pull request should contain only one commit.

- Each pull request should be independent of changes made in any other pull request.

- Each pull request should be submitted from its own topic branch in your fork of the repository.  This will make it easier to create "squashed" commits should further changes be necessary after the pull request is submitted.

GitHub pull requests are strongly preferred.  However, you may also submit patches to the [get_iplayer mailing list](http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/get_iplayer).  Make sure your patches apply cleanly to the current git tree, and that they're not mangled by your email software. Sending the patch to yourself first, then checking that you can save it to a file and apply it, is a useful technique.

**Alternate Repository**

get_iplayer's GitHub repository is mirrored with the Git repository at:
