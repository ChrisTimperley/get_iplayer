### Web PVR Manager and Internet Explorer 11

The Web PVR Manager may not launch properly after you upgrade to Internet Explorer 11.  Instead, IE 11 may display the error message "This page canâ€™t be displayed".  This is due to IE 11's Enhanced Protected Mode, which blocks access to servers running on the machine's loopback address (127.0.0.1).  By default, the Web PVR Manager's server component runs on the loopback address at: `http://127.0.0.1:1935`.  If you encounter this error, download an updated get_iplayer installer from:

<http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer_win/get_iplayer_setup_latest.exe>

and upgrade to get_iplayer 2.85.  When you run the installer, only the "get_iplayer" component should be selected for re-installation.  There is no need to re-install the helper applications.  After re-installing get_iplayer, the Web PVR Manager shortcut will launch with your browser directed to `http://localhost:1935`.
