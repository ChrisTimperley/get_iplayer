## Contribute to get_iplayer

### Code

If you would like to contribute to get_iplayer development, fork the repository on GitHub and submit a pull request with your changes:

<https://github.com/dinkypumpkin/get_iplayer>

You will need a GitHub account in order to fork the repository and submit pull requests.

Follow a few basic guidelines for pull requests:

- Each pull request should be submitted from its own topic branch in your fork of the repository.  This will make it easier to manage further changes after the pull request is submitted.

- Each pull request should contain only one new feature or a fix for a single bug.

- Each pull request should contain only one commit unless there are exceptional reasons to do otherwise.

- Each pull request should be independent of changes made in any other pull request.

- get_iplayer uses tabs for indentation - **not** spaces - and so must the changes in your pull request.

- Run `git diff --check` on your code before committing to ensure you don't have whitespace errors.  If you do, fix them before submitting your pull request.

GitHub pull requests are strongly preferred.  However, you may also submit patches to the [get_iplayer mailing list](http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/get_iplayer) so long as they conform to the above guidelines.  Make sure your patches apply cleanly to the current git tree, and that they're not mangled by your email software. Sending the patch to yourself first, then checking that you can save it to a file and apply it, is a useful technique.
