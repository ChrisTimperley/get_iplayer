h3. AtomicParsley Versions

The options related to AtomicParsley are provided to support variations in different versions that emerged after primary development ceased at version 0.9.0.

h3. Tag Encodings

The get_iplayer metadata is assumed to be encoded as UTF-8 and is then re-encoded as necessary for the different tagging applications.  This doesn't always hold true, so substitution characters may sometimes appear in the tags, particularly _lyrics_ or _longDescription_.

h2. Tag Scheme

The tag scheme is described **[[here|tagscheme]]**

If you wish to experiment with variations, the conversion of get_iplayer metadata to tag values is encapsulated in the _Tagger::tags_from_metadata_ subroutine.
